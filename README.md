## About the project

This project was made in order to learn how to design a simple React webpage using React and reusable components. This project is one of the 8 suggested projects from the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) free React course, which has also been shared on [FreeCodeCamp's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=8404s). And, as an extra, I am planning on making it responsive.
